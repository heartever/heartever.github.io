## Biography 

Dr. Wenhao Wang is an associate professor at [Institute of Information Engineering (IIE)](http://www.iie.ac.cn/), CAS. His research interests now focus on protecting user privacy data with the help of hardware features, such as [Intel SGX](https://software.intel.com/en-us/sgx), as well as cryptographic techniques (e.g., homomorphic encryption). Ongoing projects also include designing new hardware based TEEs (trusted execution environments) to support large scale data processing. Dr. Wenhao Wang was a visiting scholar of [Prof. XiaoFeng Wang](https://www.informatics.indiana.edu/xw7/)'s group in [Indiana University Bloomington](https://www.indiana.edu/) from April 2016 to August 2018, during which he worked closely with Prof. Wang and [Prof. Haixu Tang](https://www.informatics.indiana.edu/hatang/) in organizing the [Genomic data privacy and security protection competition](http://www.humangenomeprivacy.org/2017/).
