## Biography 

Dr. Wenhao Wang is an associate professor at [Institute of Information Engineering (IIE)](http://www.iie.ac.cn/), CAS. His research interests now focus on protecting user privacy data with the help of hardware features, such as [Intel SGX](https://software.intel.com/en-us/sgx), as well as cryptographic techniques (e.g., homomorphic encryption). Ongoing projects also include designing new hardware based TEEs (trusted execution environments) to support large scale data processing. Dr. Wenhao Wang was a visiting scholar of [Prof. XiaoFeng Wang](https://www.informatics.indiana.edu/xw7/)'s group in [Indiana University Bloomington](https://www.indiana.edu/) from April 2016 to August 2018, during which he worked closely with Prof. Wang and [Prof. Haixu Tang](https://www.informatics.indiana.edu/hatang/) in organizing the [Genomic data privacy and security protection competition](http://www.humangenomeprivacy.org/2017/).

**Please send an email to [wangwenhao@iie.ac.cn](mailto:wangwenhao@iie.ac.cn) if you would like to join the group. Students with interests in topics related to operating system/software/virtualization/hardware-assisted security/TEE/privacy preserving technologies/microarchitectural side channels etc., are all welcome.**

![letter](/images/news.png "news") **[Oct. 2024]** **A new paper is accepted to appear at NDSS 2025. We proposed NestedSGX, which supports existing SGX toolchains (the adapted SGX SDK and Occlum library OS) and runs SGX applications atop AMD SEV-SNP confidential VMs (CVMs).**  
  
  
![letter](/images/news.png "news") **[July. 2023]** **A new paper on side channel attacks is accepted by IEEE Transactions on Information Forensics and Security (TIFS). We showed that only 38, 40 and 39 power traces are enough to recover private key _s1_ of Dilithium 2, 3 and 5 with 100% of success rate.**
